My Blog - Nette Web Project
=================

This is a simple, blog application using the [Nette](https://nette.org) framework. It is provided with the post
creation, editing of existing posts, post removal and superuser login/logout.


Requirements
------------

- This Web Project for Nette 3.1 requires PHP 8.1+
- MySQL database service
- Apache or built-in PHP web server
- **Optional but recommended:** Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) which includes
  Apache web server and MySQL service in a single package and is (in my opinion) the best for PHP development.


Web Server Setup
----------------

### Built-in PHP server

The simplest way to get started is to start the built-in PHP server in the root directory of your project:

    php -S localhost:8000 -t www

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to see the introduction page.

> **Note:** It is important to enable extensions that will be used in your `php.ini` file (or one
> of `php.ini-development` and `php.ini-production` files) otherwise you might get various errors reported
> by [Tracy](https://tracy.nette.org/en/).
>
> One of those errors might be *"PDO Exception: Driver not found"* because the
> extension *pdo_mysql* hasn't been enabled.

### Apache

With the Apache web server provided in [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) you need to:

- Move whole project folder to `xampp/htdocs` directory
- Start up apache web server via XAMPP control panel
- Start up MySQL service via XAMPP control panel

Then you can visit `http://localhost:8080/my-blog/www/` in your browser to see the introduction page.

**It is CRITICAL that whole `app/`, `config/`, `log/` and `temp/` directories are not accessible directly
via a web browser. See [security warning](https://nette.org/security-warning).**


Before you start
----------------

You need to create and seed the database for application to work as intended from the start.
You can find the commands to seed the database in `sql/seed.sql`.
